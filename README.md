## ⚙️ Engineering & Making Things Work

As a **mechatronics engineer**, I specialize in blending mechanics, electronics, and software into meaningful solutions. I’ve built and debugged everything from sensor-driven systems to garage-born electric vehicles.

🛵 Built using upcycled materials and custom solutions—aka “I used whatever I found in the garage and tinkered until it worked.”

## 🎨 Life Beyond Code

When I’m not building things, I’m:

- 💃 Dancing jazz and swing  
- ✂️ Crafting, clothing swaps and workshops  
- 🧠 Exploring how education, healthcare, and tech overlap in surprising ways
